   The equations of kinematics for one-dimensional translation and for rotation about a fixed axis look very similar. They are

   Since the linear position and angular position equations are both quadratic in time, they should have the same behavior. Similarly, the velocity and angular velocity equations are both linear in time.

   This simulation will help you explore that similarity. A disc rotates about a fixed axis, and a block moves along a horizontal line. You can control the initial velocity/angular velocity and the force/torque for the block and disc.

   Set the initial velocity/angular velocity to 10, and the force/torque to 0.  Why are the position graphs linear? Are the velocity graphs consistent with linear position graphs?

   Set the initial velocity/angular velocity to 0, and the force/torque to -5.  Why are the velocity graphs linear? Are the position graphs consistent with linear position graphs? Why?

   Set the initial velocity/angular velocity to 10, and the force/torque to -5.  Do the block and disc reverse their respective motions at the same time?
