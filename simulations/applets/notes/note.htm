    <P>The fan on a fan cart causes the cart to accelerate at a constant rate. The value of the acceleration is determined by the fan speed. The initial position, initial velocity, and acceleration can be set. Click the Play button to view the motion of the cart.</P>
    <P>Try several combinations of position, velocity and acceleration and see how the motion and graphs differ. Then, select a combination of position, velocity and acceleration values. Sketch your prediction of the graphs, and then run the simulation to check.</P>
