   With this simulation, you can create circuits with a battery and up to three resistors. Resistor R1 is shown in red, R2 is in blue, and R3 is in green. The graph shows current versus the battery voltage. Here are some things to investigate:

     Using Circuit 1, adjust the values of the battery voltage and the
resistance of R1. How does the current change? Which law relates the
voltage, current, and resistance?

     Select Circuit 2, where R2 is in series with R1. How does the
current through R1 compare with that through R2? What is the relationship
between the voltage across R1, the voltage across R2, and the battery
voltage? (This is known as Kirchoff's loop rule.) If you now select
Circuit 3, which brings in a third resistor R3 in series with the first
two, do the same rules apply?

     Select Circuit 4, with R1 and R2 connected in parallel. How does
the voltage across R1 compare with that through R2? What is the connection
between the total current in the circuit and the current through the two
resistors? (This is known as Kirchoff's junction rule.) If you now add R3
in parallel by selecting Circuit 5, do the same rules apply?

     Circuits 6 and 7 show the three resistors connected in series-parallel
combinations. Investigate these to see how the current through each
resistor is related to the total current, and how the voltage across each
resistor is related to the battery voltage. Also, calculate the equivalent
resistance of each circuit for a particular set of R1, R2, and R3 values -
does your value agree with the "Equiv. resistor" readout in the
simulation?
