   In this simulation you can adjust the wavelength of light striking a single slit. The width of the slit is also under your control. Light diffracts as it passes through the slit, and then strikes a surface near the top of your screen. You can also control the distance between the slit and the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
   How does decreasing the wavelength of light affect the diffraction pattern? Make a prediction and then change the wavelength to 400 nm to check.
  </p>
  <p>
   The diffraction also depends on the slit width. How will decreasing the slit width change the pattern? Use the simulation to check your prediction.
  </p>
  <p>
   Yet another factor is the distance between the slit and the surface. How will increasing the distance change the diffraction pattern? Check it out.
  </p>
  <p>
   Diffraction is still important in two-slit interference. What would happen if you opened a second slit the same width as the first? Select the two-slit mode of the simulation to find out.
  </p>
  <p>
   What feature of the new pattern is controlled by the slit separation? Make a prediction and use the simulation to see if you are correct.
  </p>
  <p>
   Does changing the wavelength, slit width, or distance to the surface in the double slit case have the same effect on the pattern as in the single-slit case?
