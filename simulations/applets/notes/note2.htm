   This simulation models a ball thrown up or down with varying speeds. In addition the ball can be thrown from various heights. Run the simulation using the default initial height and velocity, and watch the graphs develop as the ball flies.
  </p>
  <p>
   How would the graphs be different if the starting height were 2m instead of 0m? Sketch your prediction, and check it out by setting the starting height to 2m. Run the simulation to check your prediction.
  </p>
  <p>
   How would the graphs be different if the initial velocity were 2m/s, instead of 0? As before, sketch your prediction, and test it using the simulation.

   You can account for air resistance in the motion by increasing the setting of the air resistance slider. How will air resistance change the shape of the graphs? Make a prediction and use the simulation to see what happens.
