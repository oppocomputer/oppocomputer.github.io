   You can use this simulation to examine the magnetic field created by the current in a wire loop. The loop is in the x-z plane, centered on the origin, with a radius of 0.6 m initially. The displayed field is in the x-y plane.

   Here are some things to consider.
   <table border="0">
    <tr>
     <td valign="top">
      1.
     </td>
     <td>
      How does the magnetic field depend on the magnitude of the current? What happens to the magnetic field if the direction of the current is reversed?
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td valign="top">
      2.
     </td>
     <td>
      Using the right-hand rule relating current and magnetic field, you should be able to predict the direction of the magnetic field created by the current in the loop. Try the right-hand rule for yourself, and make sure you get the same result for the direction of the magnetic field that the simulation does.
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td valign="top">
      3.
     </td>
     <td>
      Where is the magnetic field strongest? Is it at the very center of the loop, or near the edge of the loop?
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td valign="top">
      4.
     </td>
     <td>
      How uniform is the field inside the loop? Is the magnitude of the field significantly different at the center of the loop from what it is near the edge of the loop?
     </td>
    </tr>
   </table>
