   You can control the initial speed and launch angle of a ball, which then moves under the influence of gravity. Run the simulation using the original settings, and observe the motion and graphs.

      What is the shape of the x-position graph? What is the shape of the y-position graph? Why are they different?

      How would the position graphs change if the ball's initial velocity were doubled to 10m/s? Sketch your prediction, change the initial velocity, and run the simulation.

      What launch angle results in the longest horizontal range? Is the angle you obtain consistent with the claim made in your textbook?

   Air resistance can be added to the model for comparisons, although most questions you will address in your course will concern motion without air resistance.
