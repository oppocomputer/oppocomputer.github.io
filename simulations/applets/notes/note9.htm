   A simple pendulum oscillates with a well-defined period (the time for one complete swing cycle). What determines that period? You can control the pendulum length, the mass, and the amplitude of the swing. Try different combinations of these values, and determine which can change the period. Then answer the following questions, which will show quantitatively how the period depends on some of these values. Note that it would be hard to change g, the gravitational constant, in a real experiment, but we can do it easily here in simulation.
