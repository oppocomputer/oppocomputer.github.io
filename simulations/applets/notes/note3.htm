   Two balls are shown on your screen. Both will move to the right when you start the simulation. The upper ball moves with a constant velocity of 5m/s. The lower ball starts from rest, but moves with constant acceleration. You can set the lower ball's acceleration using a slider. The simulation stops when one ball reaches the right side of the screen. Graphs of position and velocity vs. time are shown for each ball.
  </p>
  <p>
   Run the simulation with the default value of acceleration (1m/s
   <sup>

      If the acceleration of the lower ball is doubled, what will happen to the motion? Make a prediction by sketching new graphs for the position and velocity vs. time, then set the new acceleration. Run the simulation to check your prediction.
