      Try adding a certain amount of heat at constant temperature to move the system from an initial state 1 to a final state 2. Now, returning to the same initial state, remove heat at constant volume until you arrive at the pressure of state 2, and then add heat at constant pressure until you bring the system to state 2. For the two different paths to get from state 1 to state 2, what is the same and what is different?
