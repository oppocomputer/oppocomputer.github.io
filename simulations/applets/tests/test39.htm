     How does the frequency affect the current in the circuit? With a resistor in the circuit, does changing the frequency change the magnitude of the current? What happens when a capacitor is used instead of the resistor? What happens when an inductor is used instead?

     To calculate the current in an AC circuit, you can use Ohm’s Law. This is fine for resistors, where there is an obvious value to use for R. With a capacitor or an inductor, however, there is a version of Ohm’s Law that will give the current. All that needs to be done is to define an effective resistance for the capacitor and for the inductor. What is the effective resistance of a capacitor called, and what is it equal to? What is the effective resistance of an inductor called, and what is it equal to?
