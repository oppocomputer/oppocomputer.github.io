   Just like a real boat, the boat in this simulation is limited to a maximum speed with respect to the water. How can you minimize the time needed to get to the far shore at any point? How can you minimize the time needed to get to a point directly across river from the starting point? Make these two predictions and use the simulation to check your answers.
