   Return to the default setting, with the circle's initial speed at 1 m/s, the acceleration at 0, and the Original view selected. Run the simulation to see that first setting in action. Now double the circle's initial speed. Jump to the circle's view by clicking the "View from Circle" button. Will the square move with constant speed? Make a prediction, and check it by running the simulation.
