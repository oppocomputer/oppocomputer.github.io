     It does not matter whether you go clockwise or counter-clockwise around a loop to obtain a loop equation, but what about the spot you choose as the starting and ending point? How does an equation change if you start in a different spot? Remember that you stop when you return to the starting point. Does the choice of starting point affect the values of the currents?

     There are two junctions in this circuit. Why don’t we write down junction equations for both junctions?

     An excellent way to check to see whether the currents you calculate are correct is to label the potential at different points around the circuit. You could, for instance, decide that the potential at the bottom left corner of the circuit is V = 0. The potential at the top left would therefore be equal to V1, because to get from the bottom left to the top left you cross battery 1 from negative to positive, increasing the potential by the battery voltage. Continue this process, labeling the potential everywhere. If you get consistent results for the potential at each point around the circuit, you know your calculations must be correct.
