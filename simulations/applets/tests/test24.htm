      One factor determining wave speed is the mass of the string. As the thickness of the string increases so does its mass - how does this affect the speed? Note that the tension in the string also affects the speed, but you can't see that here because the tension is always the same.

      What happens to the wavelength as the frequency increases? What about when the wave speed increases?
