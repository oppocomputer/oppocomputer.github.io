   Set the initial x velocity to zero, the initial y velocity to 5 m/s, 
and the magnetic field to zero. Set the electric field to -2 V/m, and 
the charge to 10

   C. Predict the motion of the charge. Check your 
prediction using the simulation.

   Now set the initial x velocity to 5 m/s and run the simulation. How would the motion be 
different if the mass of the charged object were to double? Make your 
prediction and check it with the simulation.
