     The situation where n2  = n1 is a special case. What happens with the reflected ray in this situation? How does the angle of refraction compare to the angle of incidence?

     Refraction occurs because light has wave properties. When light passes from one medium to a second medium with a larger index of refraction, what happens to the speed, wavelength, and frequency of the light?

     If  n1 &gt; n2 and the angle of incidence is exactly equal to the critical angle, what is the angle of refraction? Combining this information with Snell’s law, derive an expression for the critical angle in terms of  n1 and n2.
