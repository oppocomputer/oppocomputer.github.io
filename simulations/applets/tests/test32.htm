     When a single resistor is connected to a battery, the current through that resistor can be found using Ohm's Law, by dividing the battery voltage by the resistance. With more than one resistor in the circuit this no longer works - you can't find the current through a resistor by dividing the battery voltage by the resistance of the resistor. Why not? Ohm's Law still applies, but how do you use it to find the current?

     Many people have the mistaken impression that current is used up around a circuit. In a series circuit, for instance, is it true that the current decreases as it passes through the resistors? What actually happens?

     Consider a situation where a resistor is connected to a battery, and then a second resistor is connected in parallel. Does the voltage and current through the first resistor increase, decrease, or stay the same when the second resistor is added? How can you explain this?

     The answer to the previous question is based on the simulation's assumption that the battery has no internal resistance. How does the answer change if the battery has a non-negligible internal resistance?
