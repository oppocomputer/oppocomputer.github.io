   A hydrogen atom absorbs a photon carrying 2.5 eV of energy. Which energy level of the atom was occupied
   <i>
    before
   </i>
   the photon was absorbed? Which energy level of the atom was occupied
   <i>
    after
   </i>
   the photon was absorbed? Use the simulation to confirm your answers.

   Energy and frequency of light are related by E=hf, where h is Planck’s constant. Use this to determine which of the transitions you observe in this model give rise to visible light. What colors of light are emitted and absorbed?
