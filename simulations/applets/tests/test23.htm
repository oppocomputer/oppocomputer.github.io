     Why does changing from one pulley to another of a different shape, with exactly the same mass and radius, affect the acceleration?

     With the mass of the block set to a particular value, there are three different ways to change the angular acceleration of the pulley. What are these? You can check your answer using the simulation. Make each of your proposed changes one at a time, and re-run the simulation to see how the change affects the angular acceleration of the pulley.
