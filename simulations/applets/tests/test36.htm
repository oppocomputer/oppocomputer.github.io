     Consider the point exactly halfway between the two wires. Can you adjust the current so that, with current passing through each of the wires, the net field is zero here?

     Note the distance between the field lines from one of the wires. Are they equally spaced? Explain this.

     With currents of different magnitudes passing through the two wires, how do the forces on the two wires compare? What is the reason for this?
