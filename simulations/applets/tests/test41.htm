     There are many similarities between an image formed using a converging(concave) mirror and an image formed with a converging lens. Compare the two situations. What similarities do you observe? What are the differences?

     Using a converging lens or mirror, place the object at a distance that will result in a real image being formed. If you were to move the object to the position of the image, where would the image move to? Predict the answer and then try it for yourself.
