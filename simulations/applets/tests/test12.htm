      An elastic collision between objects in which one is three times heavier than the other is a special case. Set this up with the two objects having equal speeds. What happens after the collision? This is often done as an in-class demonstration, placing a baseball or tennis ball on top of a basketball and dropping them together. Try this yourself to see if the predictions of the simulation reflect reality. Be careful to avoid the top ball after the collision!

      The simulation allows you to consider superelastic collisions, in which the total energy is larger after the collision. Where could this kinetic energy have come from?
