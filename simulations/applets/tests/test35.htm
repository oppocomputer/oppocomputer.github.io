     The time constant for an RC circuit is R x C, the product of the resistance and capacitance. What does the time constant measure?

     In this simulation the battery voltage is 10 volts. When the capacitor voltage is 6 volts, what is the voltage across the resistor? Does Kirchoff’s loop rule apply to this circuit?

     While the capacitor is charging, you can press the “Discharge the capacitor” button. What does this do to the sign of the current? Why is this?

     In DC circuits that involve only resistors and batteries, the current does not change with time. By adding a capacitor, as we have done here, the current does change with time. Why is this? How does the current change as time passes?
