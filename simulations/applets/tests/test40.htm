     In a circuit with three resistors connected in series to a voltage source, the total resistance is simply the sum of the three resistances. Why is the total resistance (the impedance) found by adding the effective resistances as vectors in the RLC circuit?

     When three resistors are connected in series to a voltage source, the voltage across each resistor is less than the source voltage – in fact, the sum of the resistor voltages equals the source voltage. In the RLC circuit, can the voltage across one of the components ever be larger than the source voltage? Does Kirchoff’s loop rule apply to RLC circuits? In other words, does the sum of the voltages across the resistor, inductor, and capacitor equal the source voltage at all times?

     Resonance is a special condition in an RLC circuit. For a given set of values of R, L, and C, when the frequency is set to the resonance frequency, are the following maximized or minimized?
