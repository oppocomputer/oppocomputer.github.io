     The lowest frequency standing wave is known as the fundamental frequency. In this simulation, the fundamental frequency of the string when it is fixed at both ends is 2 Hz. What is the fundamental frequency when the string is free at both ends? What about when the string is free at only one end? Explain why this is true.

     Harmonics are standing waves that occur at frequencies higher than the fundamental frequency. If the fundamental frequency is denoted by f, at what frequency does the next harmonic occur? (e.g., 2f? 3f?). Does this depend on whether the ends of the string are both fixed, both free, or have just one end free?

     Nodes are positions of zero amplitude oscillations, while anti-nodes are positions of maximum amplitude oscillations. When the string is being driven at a standing-wave frequency, do the positions of the nodes and anti-nodes change? (This is why these patterns are known as standing waves!)

     In a standing wave, is a fixed end a node or an anti-node? What about a free end?
