      The center of the loop is at X = 0, Y = 0. The magnetic field at this point can be calculated using the equation B =

      I / 2r, where r is the radius of the loop. It is more challenging to determine the field at other places, but it can be done using the Biot-Savart Law. Look up the Biot-Savart Law in your textbook, calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field at X = 0, Y = 1 m, and see if your answer agrees with that given by the simulation at that point.
