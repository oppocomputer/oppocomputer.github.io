     The three bulbs in the simulation are identical. What is their resistance? If just one of these bulbs was connected to the 120-volt battery, how much power would be dissipated in the bulb?

     For the purposes of the simulation the resistance of the bulbs is assumed to be constant. This is not actually true – how (and why) does the resistance of a bulb change as the bulb gets brighter? You may need to do some further reading, but you can find the answer in your textbook.
